Examples of using the SurrealNumber package, including generating
figures and results used in some papers.

+ number.jl	    	 	 -- count the number of surreals in each generation 
+ dyadic_tree.jl	    	 -- plot dyadic tree
+ dyadic_tree_chi.jl	    	 -- plot coloured dyadic tree, showing it is 3 colourable
+ dyadic_tree_half.jl	    	 -- plot the positive quadrant of the dyadic tree
+ addition_tables.jl	    	 -- simple addition table, and plots a few example DAGs
+ subtraction_tables.jl	    	 -- two versions of subtraction tables, outputs a table of results, and plots few example DAGs
+ multiplication_tables.jl	 -- do a table of multiplications, and some specific example plots
+ multiplication_tables_estimates.jl -- compare generations for products with theory values

Note that almost all the plots use GraphVis, which needs to be installed.

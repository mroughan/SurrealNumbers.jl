Code for estimating the performance (speed and memory usage) for the
code. Mostly these are used for testing potential speed-up mods.

+ timing.jl   -- does a 2x table
+ timing_2.jl -- compares simple subtraction and comparison operators
+ timing_3.jl -- compares the old and new implementations of floor

Some other performance measurements take place in '''examples'''.

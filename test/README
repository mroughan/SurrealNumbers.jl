The main set of tests are, as usual, in runtest.jl

There is a set of tests of outputting to DOT format, and converting
these to SVG and PDF form using GraphViz in "test_dot.jl". These are
separate because
  + they require external functionality, which is not guaranteed to be there
  + they aren't formal tests as such, because there is no "correct"
    output
